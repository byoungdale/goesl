Forked from [0x19's library](https://github.com/0x19/goesl/) because there are things I need to add quickly and might not want to be merged.

Check it out if you need something other than what is here.

## FreeSWITCH Event Socket Library Wrapper for Go

GoESL is a small wrapper around [FreeSWITCH](https://freeswitch.org/) [Event Socket Library](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Event_Socket_Library) written in [Go](http://golang.org).

The point of this library is to fully implement FreeSWITCH ESL and bring outbound server and inbound client to the Go community :green_heart: :telephone_receiver:
